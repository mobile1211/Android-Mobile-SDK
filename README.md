# DJI Mobile SDK for Android

## Getting Started


## Concepts

- [**DJI Mobile SDK Framework Handbook**](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Handbook): 
This handbook provides a high level overview of the different components that make up the SDK, so that developers can get a feel for the SDK's structure and its different components. This handbook does not aim to provide specific information that can be found in the SDK. After reading through this handbook, developers should be able to begin working closely with the SDK.

## Sample Projects - Basic

- [**Creating a Camera Application**](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/Android-FPVDemo): Our introductory tutorial, which guides you through connecting to your drone's camera to display a live video feed in your app, through which you can take photos and videos.

- [**Importing DJI SDK Demo to Android Studio**](http://dji-dev.gitbooks.io/mobile-sdk-tutorials/content/en/Android/AndroidStudioMigration/Android_Studio_Migration_Tutorial_en.html): There are two methods we can use to import the DJI SDK Demo library into Android Studio. The first is to import the Android Studio version of the DJI SDK Demo Library to Android Studio; the second is to import the Eclipse version of the DJI SDK Demo into Android Studio.

## Sample Projects - Advanced

- [**Creating a Photo and Video Playback Application**](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/Android-PlaybackDemo): A follow up to the FPV tutorial, this tutorial teaches you how to construct an application to view media files onboard a DJI drone's SD card, specifically for **Phantom 3 Professional** and **Inspire 1**.

- **Creating a MapView and Waypoint Application** ([**GoogleMap**](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/Android-GSDemo-GoogleMap) | [**AutoNavi**](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/Android-GSDemo-Gaode-Map)): Teaches you how to construct a Groundstation app, which allows you to plot a flight route for your drone by placing waypoints on a map.

- [**Creating a Panorama Application**](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/Android-PanoramaDemo):
Learn how to build a cool panorama app. With the help of the powerful DJI SDK and OpenCV libraries, it is actually easy. you will use the Waypoint feature of Intelligent Navigation and Joystick to rotate the aircraft to take photos.
